Overview
Time Traveler GeoGame is an interactive, time-limited geography quiz where players are shown a historical event and must click its correct location on a world map.
Your goal is to score as many points as possible before time runs out — and avoid losing all your lives!
This project was developed as a web-based mini-game using modern JavaScript, Leaflet maps, and custom audio/visual effects.
🎮 Gameplay
A random historical event appears on the screen.
The player clicks on the map to guess its location.
The game calculates the distance between the guessed point and the actual event coordinates.
Points are awarded based on accuracy:
0–300 km → +50 points
300–500 km → +40 points
500–1500 km → +20 points
1500–2000 km → +5 points
2000+ km → Lose 1 life
Additional Mechanics:
Every correct guess adds +2 bonus seconds.
Players have 3 lives.
The game ends when Time runs out OR all lives are lost
Power-ups:
Skip event → once per game
+10 seconds → once per game
A floating “+50 / +40 / +20 / +5” animation appears after each guess.
Smooth zoom-in animation shows the true location after each round.

When starting the game, the player chooses:
