Overview
Time Traveler GeoGame is an interactive, time-limited geography quiz where players are shown a historical event and must click its correct location on a world map.
Your goal is to score as many points as possible before time runs out — and avoid losing all your lives!
This project was developed as a web-based mini-game using modern JavaScript, Leaflet maps, and custom audio/visual effects.
Gameplay
A random historical event appears on the screen. Then the player tries to click on the right place for that event and after that the distance between true location and the clicked location is calculated 
then we use the distance for point system.
Points are awarded based on accuracy:
0–300 km → +50 points
300–500 km → +40 points
500–1500 km → +20 points
1500–2000 km → +5 points
2000+ km → Lose 1 life
Additional Mechanics:
Every correct guess adds +2 bonus seconds.
Players have 3 lives.
The game ends when Time runs out OR all lives are lost
Power-ups: (These are new i didnt mention them in readme file so this is and upgrade)
Player can skip an event for once and player can also add 10 seconds to the timer,so player can use both powerups in one game time.
When player clicks on map and if the player guessed it right A floating “+50 / +40 / +20 / +5” animation appears after each guess.
If the player couldnt click on the right place a smooth zoom-in animation shows the true location after each round.
Game Modes (This is new it was not in readme file)
When starting the game, the player chooses:
60 seconds
90 seconds
A visible map-side timer tracks the remaining time.
Last 10 seconds mode.(This is new too)
During the last 10 seconds, the map frame flashes red and a “last 10 seconds” warning sound plays.

No infinite world wrap — fixed map boundaries
Custom styling and rounded card-style map container
